## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers
- If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices
